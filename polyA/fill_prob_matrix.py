    Fills in the probability score matrix from the support matrix. Also fills
    the origin matrix for convenience. Returns a tuple that contains the
    probability matrix and the origin matrix, in that order..

                      left-most edges of the chunk window, that should be
                      included

    We omit filling the first column because we want its probabilities to be
    zero anyway.
